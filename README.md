# database-security

This is a group coursework in the final semester. We were required to build a normalized database and grant the least privilege to every user to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability of the database.
I was responsible in:
1) Create tables with constraints
2) Insert records into tables
3) Create and grant permissions to every role
4) Table encryptions with keys and certificates
5) Auditing
